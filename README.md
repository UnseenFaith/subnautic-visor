# Subnautica Overlay Mod

Adds a simple overlay to the screen behind the normal UI elements. Useful for people who have motion sickness and need something to ground them in reality.

Afaik in my 30 minute testing, the overlay appears as it should, behind other elements, and works properly. There might be slight overlap with some other elements that aren't part of the overall "HUD". You can edit the picture inside of the mod either remove or add more to the overlay. All that is required is that it be a transparent png

The main menu gets cropped/eaten out a little bit, but shouldn't be too much of an issue. I'm not sure why that happens currently.

# Installation
Install BepinEx into your Subnautica game folder, or use a third party manager like ThunderStore

Extract the contents of the zip file into the plugins folder of BepinEx

The structure should look something like this:

.../plugins/VisorMod/VisorMod.dll
.../plugins/VisorMod/overlay.png
